# Online-Feedback-Collection-web-application-using-PHP-and-JSON

The project was undertaken as a 2nd year project in the Undergraduate Computer Science Program at the University of Nairobi.

Issues to note:

1) The email functionality uses a third-party application known as PHPMailer. Due to Google's strict access to third party applications, the functionality has been experiencing slight issues with connecting to the SMTP server. Future updates will be made to fix this issue.
2) The project was hosted on a local computer, consequently, after downloading the zip file, rename the parent folder to "boostrap8" (without the quotation marks) to avoid errors. Rename the folder and files only after carefully going through the code.
